# AlgoFPGA
A Xilinx Vivadoâ€“based FPGA accelerator library. This repository contains HDL sources, constraint files, and Tcl scripts for building and customizing hardware algorithm accelerators. Vivado-generated build artifacts, logs, and temporary files are excluded from the repo to keep it lightweight, reproducible, and collaboration-friendly.
